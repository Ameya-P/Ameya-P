<h1 align="center">Hi üëã I'm Ameya Patkar</h1>

# üí´ About Me:
I am a rising junior at Oregon State University pursuing a second bachelor‚Äôs in Computer Science after earning my first degree in Biology. My path into technology was fueled by curiosity. I taught myself Python to automate tedious data-cleaning tasks in scientific research, which sparked a realization: I could make a broader impact by developing tools and technologies that empower others, rather than limiting my reach to individual patients as a physician or researcher.

## üöÄ What I'm Up To

- üíª I'm building a website called Closet Curator as part of a mentorship program with Out in Tech. The app is built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript on the front end, Python on the backend, and deployed using Amazon Web Services. Closet Curator helps users discover their personal style by having them like or dislike clothing items through a swipe-based interface, then uses that input to give shopping suggestions, promoting both self-expression and sustainability.
